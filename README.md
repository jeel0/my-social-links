## Steps to Get Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeel0/my-social-links.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it to your preferred directory.

### 2. Update Links and Icons

Open the `index.html` file in a text editor (VSCode, Sublime, Atom, etc.) and locate the following section:

```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-link/" target="_blank">
      <i class="fab fa-linkedin icon"></i> LinkedIn
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/your-username" target="_blank">
      <i class="fab fa-github icon"></i> GitHub
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://your-portfolio-link.com" target="_blank">
      <i class="fas fa-laptop-code icon"></i> Portfolio
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

You can replace the links with your own social profiles or other relevant links. You can also change the icons using the Font Awesome icon library. Make sure to update the URLs and icon classes as needed.

### 3. Customize the Appearance

You can modify the background color, font styles, or even add animations by editing the CSS in the `<style>` section of the `index.html` file. For example, to change the background color:

```css
body {
  background-color: #2e2e2e; /* Modify the background color */
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages

To publish your webpage online using GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the Settings tab.
3. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
4. Under Source, select the `main` branch and click Save.

Your webpage will now be live at `https://your-username.github.io/my-social-links/` (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username).

### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes

After making your customizations, commit and push the changes back to your GitHub repository:

```bash
